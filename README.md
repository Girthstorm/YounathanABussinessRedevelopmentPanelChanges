Peer Review: I think the design looks amazing, i especially love the parallax features when you scroll and the text appears. I also really like that they added elements that cross over to other parts, like at the bottom of the well made and easy to read menu you can see the donuts over the menu. looks all very good and would make anyone want a donut from Mr T's Delicate Donuts.
The Mobil looks great and the nav bar being a donuts is awesome, it looks like this website was really made with mobile in mind
Im not sure if the nav bar is messed up but the text "Menu" and "Visit Us" look like they dont do anything like take you to that part of the page when it seems thats what they should be doing other than that looks and works great and i want a bacon bar

Due to Aidan not being home and unable to add collaborators we had to just copy and paste his review instead of Jeriah uploading it

Aidan: Yah sorry my bad I got multiple unskipable side quests from my father. Plus I just added Jeriah
